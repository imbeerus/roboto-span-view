## Download
Download the [latest release][1] or grab via Gradle:

```
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```
```
dependencies {
        implementation 'com.github.lndmflngs:roboto-span-view:1.0.0'
}
```
## Usage
The simplest way is to use `RobotoSpanView` like a normal `TextView`

```xml
        <com.lockwood.multispan.roboto.RobotoTwoSpanView
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:layout_height="wrap_content"
            app:firstRobotoFont="medium"
            app:firstText="Username"
            app:firstSeparator=":"
            app:orientation="vertical"
            app:secondRobotoFont="regular"
            app:secondText="Mr. Fluffypants" />
```
#### Styling
You can make your own spans like a [AlignTopSuperscriptSpan][8] and apply them in your [custom views][9]
